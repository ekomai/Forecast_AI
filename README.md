## Summary

Forecast dynamic relationship between renewable energy generation (based on weather forest) and energy storage system usage 
in order to optimize energy savings and secure funding for additional renewable energy systems.

## Background

The aim is to solve funding shortage for the purchase of (additional) energy storage systems as well as to expand renewable energy systems. 
It is a common problem not being able to forecast more precisely and optimize energy costs, 
especially for mid-sized manufacturing and R&D companies as well as for small local government with onsite energy sources. 
My interest is largely due to personal involvement and if solved successfully, it can address these 2 common energy related bottlenecks.

## How is it used?

Energy management team members (of a company and local government), energy storage providers and renewable energy system providers will be primary users. 
The solution may affect the team members who are directly responsible for monitoring and maintaining energy system hardware in terms of implementing related software and hardware solution.

## Data sources and AI methods

Weather forecast data, past, present and future, are available online at various costs and resolutions.
Energy billing rates and their changes are available for both long and short terms by the energy distribution system operators.
Detailed specification of energy storage system is available from the manufacturer.

## Challenges

The solution cannot guarantee that the energy savings will meet the expectation.
The solution can forecast different levels of funding scenarios but the desired goal may not be reached in the end.

## What next?

If successful, a number of companies and local governments will grow to form a network, 
which in turn will require expansion and improvements of Forecast system to bring further benefits.
Initially, various basic methods will be studied to verify suitability for the desired solution. 
It is most likely that this will be the first and most challenging task of the next step.

Virtual power plant and Demand Response is an inspiration and will be studied as precedents from the point of view of local adaptation of such technologies.
